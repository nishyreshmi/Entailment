# Entailment
This software prototype is meant for classification of sentence pairs into entailment, contradiction and neutral classes.
The python code is written as a package in which two modules are included - exp1.py and exp2.py. Total two experiments are conducted on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset(cited as:S. R. Bowman, G. Angeli, C. Potts, C. D. Manning, A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference, arXiv preprint arXiv:1508.05326 (2015).). Each module contains the code for each experiment. The details of the experiment carried out can be found in the paper entitled "Textual entailment classification using syntactic structures and semantic relations.", [Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems: Applications in Engineering and Technology][Volume 45][Issue 1]2023pp 929â€“939 https://doi.org/10.3233/JIFS-22327
